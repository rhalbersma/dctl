DCTL: Draughts and Checkers Template Library.
=============================================

A C++ template library for the games of draughts and checkers, supporting all known rules variations, board sizes and game objectives.

Introduction
============

Dependencies
============

### C++11

The DCTL is a modern C++ library that is dependent on many of the features that came available with the new C++11 Standard.
Compiler support for C++11 differs across compilers. See http://wiki.apache.org/stdcxx/C%2B%2B0xCompilerSupport for an up-to-date overview.

### Boost

The DCTL also uses the Boost libraries in many places. In particular, the Boost Metaprogramming Library (Boost.MPL) is heavily used.

### Mercurial distributed version control system 

Installation
============

### Header-only

The DCTL is a header-only library. This means that you can include any header in your own program
and compile and link your own program within your build environment. That's it!

### Unit-testing

The DCTL comes with an extensive suite of unit tests. These can be found under the dctl/test subdirectory.
Running these tests requires that you statically link against the Boost.Test libraries. See the platform
specific notes (below) on how to do that.
